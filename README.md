## Features

- Very fast and accurate **face replacement (face swap)** in images
- **Multiple faces support**
- **Gender detection**
- Ability to **save original images** (made before swapping)
- **Face restoration** of a swapped face
- **Upscaling** of a resulting image
- Saving ans loading **Safetensors Face Models**
- **Facial Mask Correction** to avoid any  pixelation around face contours
- Ability to set the **Postprocessing order**
- **100% compatibility** with different **SD WebUIs**: Automatic1111, SD.Next, Cagliostro Colab UI
- **Fast performance** even with CPU, ReActor for SD WebUI is absolutely not picky about how powerful your GPU is
- **CUDA** acceleration support since version 0.5.0
- **[API](/API.md) support**: both SD WebUI built-in and external (via POST/GET requests)
- **ComfyUI [support](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node)**
- **Mac M1/M2 [support](https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-reactor/issues/42)**
- Console **log level control**
- **NSFW filter free** (this extension is aimed at highly developed intellectual people, not at perverts; our society must be oriented on its way towards the highest standards, not the lowest - this is the essence of development and evolution; so, my position is - that mature-minded people are clever enough to understand for themselves what is good and what is bad and take full responsibility for personal actions; for others - no "filters" will help until they do understand how Universe works)

## Usage

> Using this software you are agree with [disclaimer](#disclaimer)

1. Under "ReActor" drop-down menu, import an image containing a face;
2. Turn on the "Enable" checkbox;
3. That's it, now the generated result will have the face you selected.

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/sd-webui-reactor/example.jpg?raw=true" alt="example" width="808"/>

### Face Indexes

ReActor detects faces in images in the following order:<br>
left->right, top->bottom

And if you need to specify faces, you can set indexes for source and input images.

Index of the first detected face is 0.

You can set indexes in the order you need.<br>
E.g.: 0,1,2 (for Source); 1,0,2 (for Input).<br>
This means: the second Input face (index = 1) will be swapped by the first Source face (index = 0) and so on.

### Genders

You can specify the gender to detect in images.<br>
ReActor will swap a face only if it meets the given condition.

### The result face is blurry
Use the "Restore Face" option. You can also try the "Upscaler" option or for more finer control, use an upscaler from the "Extras" tab.
You can also set the postproduction order (from 0.1.0 version):
<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/sd-webui-reactor/pp-order.png?raw=true" alt="example"/>

*The old logic was the opposite (Upscale -> then Restore), resulting in worse face quality (and big texture differences) after upscaling.* 

### There are multiple faces in result
Select the face numbers you wish to swap using the "Comma separated face number(s)" option for swap-source and result images. You can use different index order.
<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/sd-webui-reactor/multiple-faces.png?raw=true" alt="example"/>

### ~~The result is totally black~~
~~This means NSFW filter detected that your image is NSFW.~~

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/sd-webui-reactor/IamSFW.jpg?raw=true" alt="IamSFW" width="50%"/>

### Img2Img

You can choose to activate the swap on the source image or on the generated image, or on both using the checkboxes. Activating on source image allows you to start from a given base and apply the diffusion process to it.

ReActor works with Inpainting - but only the masked part will be swapped.<br>Please use with the "Only masked" option for "Inpaint area" if you enabled "Upscaler". Otherwise use the upscale option via the Extras tab or via the Script loader (below the screen) with "SD upscale" or "Ultimate SD upscale".

### Extras Tab

From the version 0.5.0 you can use ReActor via the Extras Tab. It gives a superfast perfomance and ability to swap face2image avoiding SD pipeline that can cause smushing of original image's details

<img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/sd-webui-reactor/extras_tab.jpg?raw=true" alt="IamSFW"/>

## API

You can use ReActor with the built-in Webui API or via an external API.

Please follow **[this](/API.md)** page for the detailed instruction.

## Troubleshooting

### **I. "You should at least have one model in models directory"**

Please, check the path where "inswapper_128.onnx" model is stored. It must be inside the folder `stable-diffusion-webui\models\insightface`. Move the model there if it's stored in a different directory.

### **II. Any problems with installing Insightface or other dependencies**

(for Mac M1/M2 users) If you get errors when trying to install Insightface - please read https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-reactor/issues/42

(for Windows Users) If you have VS C++ Build Tools or MS VS 2022 installed but still have a problem, then try the next step:
1. Close (stop) your SD WebUI Server and start it again
   
(for Any OS Users) If the problem still there, then do the following:
1. Close (stop) your SD WebUI Server if it's running
2. Go to (Windows)`venv\Lib\site-packages` folder or (MacOS/Linux)`venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages`
3. If you see any folders with names start from `~` (e.g. "~rotobuf") - delete them
4. Go to (Windows)`venv\Scripts` or (MacOS/Linux)`venv/bin`
5. Run Terminal or Console (cmd) for that folder and type `activate`
6. Update your pip at first: `pip install -U pip`
7. Then one-by-one:
   - `pip install insightface==0.7.3`
   - `pip install onnx`
   - `pip install "onnxruntime-gpu>=1.16.1"`
   - `pip install opencv-python`
   - `pip install tqdm`
8. Type `deactivate`, you can close your Terminal or Console and start your SD WebUI, ReActor should start OK - if not, welcome to the Issues section.

### **III. "TypeError: UpscaleOptions.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'do_restore_first'"**

First of all - you need to disable any other Roop-based extensions:
- Go to 'Extensions -> Installed' tab and uncheck any Roop-based extensions except this one
  <img src="https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/sd-webui-reactor/roop-off.png?raw=true" alt="uncompatible-with-other-roop"/>
- Click 'Apply and restart UI'

Alternative solutions: 
- https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-reactor/issues/3#issuecomment-1615919243
- https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-reactor/issues/39#issuecomment-1666559134 (can be actual, if you use Vladmandic SD.Next)

### **IV. "AttributeError: 'FaceSwapScript' object has no attribute 'enable'"**

Probably, you need to disable the "SD-CN-Animation" extension (or perhaps some another that causes the conflict)

### **V. "INVALID_PROTOBUF : Load model from <...>\models\insightface\inswapper_128.onnx failed:Protobuf parsing failed" OR "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'" OR "AttributeError: 'FaceSwapScript' object has no attribute 'save_original'"**

This error may occur if there's smth wrong with the model file `inswapper_128.onnx`

Try to download it manually from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gourieff/ReActor/resolve/main/models/inswapper_128.onnx)
and put it to the `stable-diffusion-webui\models\insightface` replacing existing one

### **VI. "ValueError: This ORT build has ['TensorrtExecutionProvider', 'CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider'] enabled" OR "ValueError: This ORT build has ['AzureExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider'] enabled"**

1. Close (stop) your SD WebUI Server if it's running
2. Go to the (Windows)`venv\Lib\site-packages` or (MacOS/Linux)`venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages` and see if there are any folders with names start from "~" (for example "~rotobuf"), delete them
3. Go to the (Windows)`venv\Scripts` or (MacOS/Linux)`venv/bin` run Terminal or Console (cmd) there and type `activate`
4. Then:
- `python -m pip install -U pip`
- `pip uninstall -y onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu onnxruntime-silicon onnxruntime-extensions`
- `pip install "onnxruntime-gpu>=1.16.1"`

If it didn't help - it seems that you have another extension reinstalling `onnxruntime` when SD WebUI checks requirements. Please see your extensions list. Some extensions can causes reinstalling of `onnxruntime-gpu` to `onnxruntime<1.16.1` every time SD WebUI runs.<br>ORT 1.16.0 has a bug https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/17631 - don't install it!

### **VII. "ImportError: cannot import name 'builder' from 'google.protobuf.internal'"**

1. Close (stop) your SD WebUI Server if it's running
2. Go to the (Windows)`venv\Lib\site-packages` or (MacOS/Linux)`venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages` and see if there are any folders with names start from "~" (for example "~rotobuf"), delete them
3. Go to the "google" folder (inside the "site-packages") and delete any folders there with names start from "~"
4. Go to the (Windows)`venv\Scripts` or (MacOS/Linux)`venv/bin` run Terminal or Console (cmd) there and type `activate`
5. Then:
- `python -m pip install -U pip`
- `pip uninstall protobuf`
- `pip install "protobuf>=3.20.3"`

If this method doesn't help - there is some other extension that has a wrong version of protobuf dependence and SD WebUI installs it on a startup requirements check

<a name="insightfacebuild">

### **VIII. (For Windows users) If you still cannot build Insightface for some reasons or just don't want to install Visual Studio or VS C++ Build Tools - do the following:**

1. Close (stop) your SD WebUI Server if it's running
2. Download and put [prebuilt Insightface package](https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-reactor/raw/main/example/insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl) into the stable-diffusion-webui (or SD.Next) root folder where you have "webui-user.bat" file or (A1111 Portable) "run.bat"
3. From stable-diffusion-webui (or SD.Next) root folder run CMD and `.\venv\Scripts\activate`<br>OR<br>(A1111 Portable) Run CMD
4. Then update your PIP: `python -m pip install -U pip`<br>OR<br>(A1111 Portable)`system\python\python.exe -m pip install -U pip`
5. Then install Insightface: `pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl`<br>OR<br>(A1111 Portable)`system\python\python.exe -m pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl`
6. Enjoy!

### **IX. 07-August-23 Update problem**

If after `git pull` you see the message: `Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy` and then when you check `git status` you see `Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by`

Please do the next:

Inside the folder `extensions\sd-webui-reactor` run Terminal or Console (cmd) and then:
- `git reset f48bdf1 --hard`
- `git pull`

OR

Just delete the folder `sd-webui-reactor` inside the `extensions` directory and then run Terminal or Console (cmd) and type `git clone https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-reactor`
